    topic: OSPF
    question: |
      Which two statements are true about OSPF areas? (Choose two)
    options:
      A: All OSPF routers must be in area 0
      B: OSPF backbone area is area 0
      C: Inter-area routing happens via area 0
      D: Stub areas can redistribute external routes
      E: OSPF does not support summarization
    answer: [B, C]
    explanation: |
      Area 0 is the OSPF backbone area. All inter-area traffic must pass through area 0. External route redistribution is not allowed in stub areas.

    question: |
      What is the function of the CAPWAP protocol in wireless networks?
    options:
      A: Encrypt user data traffic end-to-end
      B: Provide tunneling between AP and WLC
      C: Assign IP addresses to wireless clients
      D: Facilitate VLAN trunking between switches
    answer: [B]
    explanation: |
      CAPWAP encapsulates control and data traffic between the AP and the Wireless LAN Controller, enabling centralized management.
